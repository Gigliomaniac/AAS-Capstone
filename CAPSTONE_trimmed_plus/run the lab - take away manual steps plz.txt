	How to actually DO the lab lol:

	Make sure you're in us-east-1 - VIRGINIA
		1. Allocate an elastic IP to Troubled instance
		2. Attach a copy of "pingable" security group to Troubled instances VPC ID - security group
			2.1 Change security groups in security of EC2 - under actions at the instance
			2.2 Make sure to select "add" and delete the other sg inside
		3. go to subnets
			3.1 Find the private subnet IP that matches Troubled Instance
			3.2 select the subnet - go to NACLs just to view the rules
			3.3 go to route table association for the subnet and change to public-rt-2
			***# not necessary #*** 3.3 return to subnets, choose the same one, change it to the NACL that has an igw via Edit network ACL association
		4. ping it fr


		5. (for me) manually delete new EIP and SG
